            <p>Lopatin's debut under Oneohtrix Point Never accompasses through cold ambient soundscapes, <br>
                with his synth sequences reminiscent of early Electronic music </p> <br>

            <h2>review</h2>
            <p>Magic 106.7 Radio started in December 1957, under the call name of WBZ-FM, it was a humble radio station, playing regular adult contemporary music around the Boston metro area. The name of this station eventually turned into Daniel Lopatin's most known and successful pseudonym of his, this alias was met with music so experimental that it cancels out the Pop music playing on the station.  <br>
            <br>
            Eventually Magic One 'Oh Six Point Seven became Magic Oneohtrix Point Never, a culmination of things before, using new and recently invented production methods, to create something that sounds like a born and raised time-traveller would, their minds mixed with old, present and future. Starting from his Dad's' Roland Juno-60 synth and an arpeggio, to creating complex and masterful works in Ableton and Serum <br>
            <br>
            However, this growth has to come from somewhere. Starting with Betrayed in the Octagon. <br>
            <br>
            His early works represent music from a time before, styles considered new and fresh at the moment, slowly decaying into a melancholy version of itself. Kind of like one of those Christmas cards that plays Jingle Bells when you open then, and after the holiday season, you throw it away and it deteriorates until the batteries become dead or corroded. Betrayed in the Octagon, Zones Without People, and the rest of the projects featured on his later compilation Rifts, encapsulates this kind of feeling. Being nostalgic for a time you weren't there for. (like Boards of Canada!)<br>
            <br>
            Enough with the intro, time to dig in to this.<br>
            <br>
            The album begins into this slowly moving 8, around 9 minute ambient piece, Woe is the Transgression 1. As the synth drones on like a fridge at night, you could hear Lopatin slowly adjusting each knob of the synth, changing the detune or the octave every minute or so. Making it into this hauntigly beautiful work of Ambient art, it serves as an excellent introduction to the album, and his early works in general as you would see later. At the track fades into silence, you could hear the siren slowly turning back in its original state.<br> 
            <br>
            The next track, Behind the Bank, starts with this relaxing droning horn, then the lead synth starts up, playing riffs. A memory of a cold Winter day, the Sun slowly rising after hours of darkness, driving through the snow to get to work. The landscape seems dead and the architecture surrounding isn't any better. All you can see are roads and buildings, it is a better civilization than what most people get but are you sure its good? You still have a job, a house, money, and a house, things that most people would die for. But you lack the sense of life within, acting as a machine for the higher social classes. Something that could be replaced if it affected their salary <a href="https://www.vidbinge.com/media/tmdb-tv-2004-malcolm-in-the-middle/5949/137459">(or their status)</a>. You think to yourself "Why are we like this?", before continuing on with what you're doing.<br>
            <br>
            Eyeballs is a dark experimental piece. That thought from before being warped into a depression, you do the same things every day with no though added into them, there is nothing going forward. Empty. You surrender your youth for something worse. Same case for the aging IBM computer, it keeps on going until being replaced, experiencing the fate of the working man. Decaying as months, years, decades, go on. There is nothing going forward. <br>
