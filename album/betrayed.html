            <p>Lopatin's debut under Oneohtrix Point Never accompasses through cold ambient soundscapes, <br>
                with his synth sequences reminiscent of early Electronic music </p> <br>

            <h2>review</h2>
            <p>Magic 106.7 Radio started in December 1957, under the call name of WBZ-FM, it was a humble radio station, playing regular adult contemporary music around the Boston metro area. The name of this station eventually turned into Daniel Lopatin's most known and successful pseudonym of his, this alias was met with music so experimental that it cancels out the Pop music playing on the station.  <br>
            <br>
            Eventually Magic One 'Oh Six Point Seven became Magic Oneohtrix Point Never, a culmination of things before, using new and recently invented production methods, to create something that sounds like a born and raised time-traveller would, their minds mixed with old, present and future. Starting from his Dad's' Roland Juno-60 synth and an arpeggio, to creating complex and masterful works in Ableton and Serum <br>
            <br>
            However, this growth has to come from somewhere. Starting with Betrayed in the Octagon. <br>
            <br>
            His early works represent music from a time before, styles considered new and fresh at the moment, slowly decaying into a melancholy version of itself. Kind of like one of those Christmas cards that plays Jingle Bells when you open then, and after the holiday season, you throw it away and it deteriorates until the batteries become dead or corroded. <br>
            <br>
            Betrayed in the Octagon, Zones Without People, and the rest out</p>
